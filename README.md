# CSCE636
This repo contains the codes and files associated with the course project of CSCE 636, Deep Learning.
For training the network, the code file 'Training.ipynb' is to be run. 
For testing the trained network on the test set, the code file 'test_set.ipynb' is to be run.
For testing the trained network on a custom video as input, use the code file 'Prediction.ipynb'

Be sure to correct the file paths throughout the code files before running, and if testing, download the model architecture and weight files as well.

The folder Model and Weights contain the saved model and weights to be used in the test_set and prediction files.
